December 2023 - diving deep into React Server Components and the new paradigms.

# Server Components Overview

React Server Components represent a fundamental shift in how we think about rendering:

- **Server-side rendering** without the hydration cost
- **Direct database access** from components
- **Automatic code splitting** at the component level

## Key Benefits

The most compelling advantages include:

1. Zero client-side JavaScript for server components
2. Direct access to backend resources
3. Improved performance for data-heavy apps

```jsx
// Server Component (runs on server)
async function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const user = await db.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: userId }
  });
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <ClientCounter initialCount={user.postCount} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

> The future of React is looking very promising with these server-first patterns.
