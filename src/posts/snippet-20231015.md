A utility function for retrying failed promises with exponential backoff:

```typescript
interface RetryOptions {
  retries: number;
  delay: number;
  backoff: number;
}

async function withRetry<T>(
  fn: () => Promise<T>,
  options: RetryOptions = { retries: 3, delay: 1000, backoff: 2 }
): Promise<T> {
  const { retries, delay, backoff } = options;
  
  try {
    return await fn();
  } catch (error) {
    if (retries <= 0) {
      throw error;
    }
    
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    
    return withRetry(fn, {
      retries: retries - 1,
      delay: delay * backoff,
      backoff
    });
  }
}

// Usage
const data = await withRetry(
  () => fetch('/api/data').then(r => r.json()),
  { retries: 5, delay: 500, backoff: 1.5 }
);
```

Essential for handling unreliable network requests or external API calls.
