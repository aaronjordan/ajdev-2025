August has been productive with the summer development sprint.

# Focus Areas

We concentrated on three main areas:

1. **Performance optimization** - Reduced load times by 40%
2. **User experience improvements** - New onboarding flow
3. **Infrastructure upgrades** - Migration to new hosting

## Technical Achievements

The biggest win was implementing lazy loading:

```typescript
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./ExpensiveComponent'));
```

This simple change had massive impact on initial page load performance.
